### Data Structures and Algorithms
Just a collection of data structures and algorithms that have been mentioned in my DSA uni class
that I've implemented for practice and understanding.

#### Implemented
| Data Structures |
| --------------- |
| - Linked List   |
| - Queue         |
| - Stack         |

| Sorting Algorithms |
| ------------------ |
| - Insertion Sort   |
| - Merge Sort       |

| Search Algorithms |
| ----------------- |
| - Binary Search   |
| - Fibonacci       |



Todo:
- Radix sort
- Quick sort
- Interpolation search
- Fast search
- heap sort

- Heap + heapify
- Binary tree
- hash table
