### Data Structures and Algorithms
Just a collection of data structures and algorithms that have been mentioned in my DSA uni class
that I've implemented for practice and understanding.

#### Data Structures
- Linked List
- Queue
- Stack

#### Sorting Algorithms
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
  - Divide and conquer algorithm
    1. Pick a pivot element (often last element)
    2. Partition: rearrange so that all elements less than pivot are moved to the left
      and greater than are moved to the right. Now the pivot is in it's final posistion.
    3. Repeat 1 and 2 on the sub-arrays with greater and smaller elements

#### Search Algorithms
- Binary Search


- Fibonacci

#### Todo:
- Heap + heapify
- Binary tree
- Hash table (chaining and open keys)
- Dynamic array

- Radix sort
- Heap sort
- B-sort (Baumsortieren)

- Linear search
- Fast search
